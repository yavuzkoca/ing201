According to an analysis based on Poisson distribution, an accepted probability theory,
there would be a need for an autonomous car to travel 725,000 miles without incident to be 99% sure that
it was safer than a car with a human driver.

Paraphrase

“A verified probability theory Poisson distribution based research assert that
traveling 725,000 miles with a self driving car 99 percent doesn’t make an accident.
It proves that a self driving car is safer in comparison with a car with human driver”
